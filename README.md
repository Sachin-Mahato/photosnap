## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Route Handling

### What I learned

I've used TailwindCSS for a few smaller projects but this was the first time using it at something bigger, I am happy with the results but feel I could still simplify things further.

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - The CSS king himself, never fails to help me with niche issues to weird CSS problems.
- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - The Tailwind Docs are amazing, I am getting more familiar with Tailwind but when I do need to find some class name it takes just seconds.
